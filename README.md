Hello!
I'm Sergey Kirichenko, glad to see you at my profile!

I'm a Bauman Moscow State Technical University student, so you can see a lot of `bmstu-*` repositories over here -- those are for the next generations.

Moreover, I do am into things like:
- âœ¨ functional programming;
- â˜• formal language theory;
- ðŸ‘¾ low-level programming.

Feel free to create pull requests, open issues, etc -- every collaboration is heartly appreciated!
